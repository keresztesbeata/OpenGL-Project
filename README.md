# OpenGL-Project
Graphics Processing course, 3rd year, 1st sem

The aim of this project was to create a photo-realistic presentation of a 3D scene, and the chosen theme was a basketball game simulation.
The player is able to view and traverse the scene, which in this case is the basketball field, or to interact with the ball.
The different light sources, shadow mapping, texture mapping and animations add to the photo-realistic effect of the whole scene.
